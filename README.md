# Purely Functional Data Structures in Idris [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timjb/idris-pfds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timjb/idris-pfds)

This is a collection of purely functional data structures implemented in Idris, some of them adapted from Chris Okasaki's book. Where possible, I tried to use size-indexed types.

Compatibility: Requires Idris >= 0.11
